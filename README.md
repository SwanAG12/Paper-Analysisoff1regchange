In my paper, I have used the FastF1 python package. FastF1 gives you access to F1 lap timing, car telemetry and position, tyre data, weather data, the event schedule and session results.
Main features:
-Access to F1 timing data, telemetry, sessions results and more
-Full support for Ergast to access current and historical F1 data
-All data is provided in the form of extended Pandas DataFrames to make working with the data easy while having powerful tools available
-Adds custom functions to the Pandas objects specifically to make working with F1 data quick and simple
-Integration with Matplotlib to facilitate data visualization
-Implements caching for all API requests to speed up your scripts
FastF1 is open source. Everyone can download it onto a jupyter notebook and use it to access telemetry data. After
